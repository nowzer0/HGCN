## Requirements
* python 3.9.11
* pytorch 2.2.0
* pytorch-lightening 1.2.4
* transformers 4.3.3
* run pip install -r requirements.txt to install rest of the dependencies


## Dataset
Using meta-data to develop a model for detecting low-quality documents with inconsistency issues, we constructed an _Inconsistency Dataset_. 
The data used in the dataset construction covered various news fields and were obtained from one of South Koreaâ€™s largest news outlets, Yonhap News.
The dataset contains 216,512 samples split into a 9:0.5:0.5 train-validation-test ratio, resulting in 194,860 training data, 10,826 validation data, and 10,826 test data.

_Inconsistency dataset_ was created by [IDSL](https://sites.google.com/dm.snu.ac.kr/idsl/home) of Hanyang University in Republic of Korea. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eNIsxaRtHXP6I4VaCiIKmbQRNm_Yo4mT?usp=drive_link).

More information about _Inconsistency dataset_ can be found in Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network Approach for Detecting Low-Quality Documents.
